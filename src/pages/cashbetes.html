        <h2>—Project</h2>
        <p>
          In a groundbreaking campaign during Black Friday, CashBetes became
          Brazil’s first cashback marketing initiative targeting people with
          diabetes. The concept was simple yet powerful: when customers
          purchased a life insurance policy, the value of their first monthly
          fee was returned as credits to the
          <a href="https://gliconline.net/" target="_blank"> Glic Online</a> and
          <a href="https://www.diabetescenter.com.br/" target="_blank">
            Diabetic Center</a
          >, online platforms dedicated to providing care and selling essential
          diabetes supplies like insulin, glucometers, sensors, syringe, strips,
          and other crucial tools for managing the condition. <br /><br />
          The campaign was designed to leverage the high consumer activity
          during Black Friday, a time when many people are eager to make online
          purchases. By connecting this buying impulse with the importance of
          taking care of diabetes, we not only promoted life insurance as a
          means of financial security but also encouraged proactive health
          management.
          <br /><br />
          I had the opportunity to develop the initiative from inception to
          completion, utilizing 20 digital influencers within the diabetes
          community to spread the message, supported by email marketing, social
          media content, and paid media. These efforts led to a 32% increase in
          monthly insurance sales, proving the campaign’s success in driving
          both brand awareness and performance.
