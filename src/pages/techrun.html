        <p>
          Tech Run 2024 offered a unique opportunity to merge technology,
          innovation, and health. The event took participants along a scenic
          route by the Tejo River in Lisbon, bringing together startup founders,
          venture capitalists, and tech enthusiasts in a dynamic setting where
          they could connect over a shared passion for sport and wellness.
          <br /><br />
          With 500 participants from 38 countries, the event saw a gender
          distribution of 33% women and 67% men, while tech runners represented
          over 170 companies from more than 25 industries. This diverse
          participation reinforced Portugal Tech Run’s role as a platform for
          networking and collaboration across multiple sectors.
          <br /><br />
          I had the opportunity to contribute by developing the website to
          manage registrations and event details, along with supporting the
          creation of videos and communication materials to promote the
          initiative and engage the community. As a result of my involvement,
          the website saw 11,000 views and 4,458 active users, significantly
          boosting participation and engagement.
