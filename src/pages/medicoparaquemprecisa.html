        <h2>—Project</h2>
        <p>
          The #medicoParaQuemPrecisa campaign was a collaborative initiative
          between the online scheduling platform Doutor Já and Policlínica
          Granato in Rio de Janeiro city, designed to ease the burden on
          Brazil's public health system (SUS) by providing free medical
          consultations to those in need.
          <br /><br />
          For every appointment booked through Doutor Já at these partner
          policlínics, an additional free consultation was made available to a
          SUS patient, ensuring faster access to medical care for those stuck in
          long public waitlists.

        <p>
          Launched in February 2016, the campaign initially set out to provide
          100 free consultations, but overwhelming demand and a highly positive
          response quickly led to an expanded goal of 1,000 consultations. More
          than just delivering immediate medical care, the initiative fostered a
          strong sense of community support—patients who scheduled their own
          appointments indirectly contributed to helping those in need.
          <br /><br />
          As Co-founder and Head of Marketing at Doutor Já, I had the privilege
          of leading this initiative, developing strategic partnerships and
          executing communication efforts to maximize its impact. By bridging
          the gap between private healthcare services and public demand, this
          campaign successfully created real social impact, making quality
          medical care more accessible for those who needed it most.
