        <h2>—Project</h2>
        <p>
          At Pomodoro timer project, I have created the renowned Pomodoro
          Technique using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a clear understanding
          of the technique's principles, I crafted a user-friendly interface
          that seamlessly guides users through focused study or work sessions
          and well-deserved breaks.
          <br /><br />
          Through meticulous attention to detail and a focus on user experience,
          I ensured that Pomodoro timer provided an intuitive and effective
          platform for increasing focus and productivity. Utilizing HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript, I designed Pomodoro timer to facilitate the structured
          work and break cycles integral to the Pomodoro Technique. The
          interface guides users through 25-minute work sessions followed by
          5-minute breaks, with longer breaks interspersed after every fourth
          session. 
          <br><br>
          Drawing upon my experience with Figma, I translated design
          concepts into functional elements, ensuring a visually appealing and
          cohesive user experience. By adhering to the core principles of the
          Pomodoro Technique and incorporating user feedback, Pomodoro timer
          empowers users to cultivate more effective study habits, enhance
          concentration, and achieve consistent results while maintaining a
          healthy work-life balance.
