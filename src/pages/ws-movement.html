        <h2>—Project</h2>
        <p>
          WinSocial’s Movement was a transformative campaign designed to inspire
          people to adopt healthier habits through an engaging, challenge-based
          reward system. Participants were encouraged to complete
          movement-focused tasks—running, biking, walking, or any physical
          activity—within a set period, unlocking increasing levels of rewards.
          <br /><br />
          From discount vouchers on online sports platforms to complete running
          kits and smartwatches, the more challenges completed, the greater the
          benefits. Structured in three key phases, the initiative first
          required participants to join a WhatsApp group to stay informed. Next,
          they engaged with various tasks such as following WinSocial on
          Instagram, watching live sessions with digital influencers and health
          professionals, posting their activities using #movimentowinsocial, and
          ultimately joining the campaign’s official run. This multi-step
          approach not only built a strong sense of community but also
          reinforced long-term healthy habits.
          <br /><br />
          I had the privilege of proposing and convincing the CEO to launch this
          initiative, while also leading the entire communication
          strategy—including starring in a promotional video—in collaboration
          with Lifestyle Medicine Specialist
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gisellefelix/" target="_blank">

          >
          . Through our efforts, nearly 400 participants joined the challenge,
          with 24% completing all tasks, demonstrating the campaign’s success in
          motivating people toward a more active lifestyle.
