        <h2>—Project</h2>
        <p>
          At Flashcards, I create an interactive study tool inspired by the
          flashcards methodology, developed to help students memorize content.
          In this responsive project, I chose TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ReactJS,
          and NextJS, which meticulously crafted a complete front-end project
          that seamlessly integrated Figma's design specifications into a
          dynamic and visually engaging learning environment.
          <br /><br />
          Starting with ideation and design system specifications in Figma, I
          translated these concepts into tangible components using Tailwind CSS
          to maintain visual consistency and efficiency. Through the power of
          ReactJS and NextJS, I brought these designs to life, implementing
          interactive features and seamless navigation to enhance the user
          experience.
          <br /><br />
          The challenge of migrating design specifications to the development
          environment was met with precision, ensuring that key visual standards
          were preserved throughout the project. By combining cutting-edge
          technologies with a user-centered approach, Flashcards is a tool for
          facilitating and engaging learning experiences.
