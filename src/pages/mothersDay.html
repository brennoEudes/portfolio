        <p>
          The "Mamãe Passou Açúcar em Mim" webinar was a heartfelt initiative
          created for Mother's Day, emphasizing the essential role mothers play
          in caring for children with diabetes.
          <br /><br />
          Promoted by WinSocial, an insurtech offering life insurance for
          individuals with chronic diseases, the event featured
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >José Loreto (4.5M followers)</a
          >, the renowned Brazilian actor who has lived with type 1 diabetes
          since he was 14, alongside his mother Mariza Freixo, and

            >Christine Rolke, founder of @mãepâncreas</a
          >
          and Diabetes Educator at the Brazilian Diabetes Society (SBD).
          Together, they shared an intimate and insightful conversation on
          diabetes care, the importance of education, and the emotional journey
          of managing the condition.
          <br /><br />
          Broadcast live on YouTube and Instagram's WinSocial, the webinar
          became a landmark event for the diabetes community, reaching over 500
          simultaneous viewers. This powerful discussion not only offered
          valuable guidance on treatment and support, but also highlighted the
          critical role parents play in ensuring their children lead healthy,
          empowered lives while managing diabetes.
          <br /><br />
          In the second phase of the campaign, we launched a sales promotional
          initiative for Mother’s Month, in which each life insurance policy sold
          came with a free Mães Pâncreas Diabetes Course. This educational
          program was designed to help mothers and fathers learn best practices
          for managing diabetes in their children, further reinforcing the
          campaign’s mission.
          <br /><br />
          I had the privilege of contributing to this initiative by leading
          content creation and event promotion, boosting WinSocial's Instagram
          reach to over 27,000 users, attracting new followers, and driving a
          15% conversion rate for life insurance plans tailored to diabetic
          individuals. This demonstrated the webinar’s strong impact in raising
          brand awareness and providing tangible support for the community.
